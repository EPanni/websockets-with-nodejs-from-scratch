### Notes
- Should you have some difficulties solving the problems, please comment on the [**Youtube video**]()

- As soon as you've been finishing the tasks, comment on the  [**Youtube video**]() so all other students can be pushed forward by your efforts

## Running

- Server - Use the Node.js v18 and execute the [server.mjs](./nodejs-raw-websocket/server.mjs) file as `node nodejs-raw-websocket/server.mjs`
- Client - You just need to open the [index.html](./nodejs-raw-websocket/index.html) file on a browser. (I use Firefox for the examples) 

## Have fun!
